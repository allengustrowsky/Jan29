Create a website for a fictional soccer team, "The Thunderbolts." The website should include the following pages:

* Home page that includes an overview of the team and a schedule of upcoming games.
* Roster page that lists the players on the team, including their positions and jersey numbers.
* History page that details the team's history, including past seasons and notable achievements.
* Tickets page that provides information on how to purchase tickets to Thunderbolts games.

In addition to the pages listed above, be sure to include standard website elements such as a navigation menu, footer, and contact information. Be creative with the design and layout of the website, and try to incorporate the soccer-themed assets you've gathered in a visually pleasing way.

                <h1>Ticket information</h1>
                <p>To get tickets for Thunderbolt FC's games, you can contact the team's ticket office directly to inquire about ticket availability and prices. You can also try reaching out to authorized ticket vendors such as Ticketmaster, StubHub, or Vivid seats for the games.</p>
                <p>Another option would be to check for any promotions or discounts that the team may be offering. Some teams also offer special packages for season ticket holders, which include tickets to all home games for the season at a discounted rate.</p>
                <p>It's also worth keeping an eye on the team's social media channels for any updates on ticket sales or promotions. Please note that ticket availability and prices may vary depending on the game and the location of the seats. Some games are more popular than others, so it's always best to buy tickets well in advance to ensure that you get the best seats at the best price.</p>
